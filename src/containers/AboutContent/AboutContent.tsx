          <p>Hi, I'm <span className={styles.name}>emily</span></p>
          <p>Ask me to tell you the story of how I discovered I could write legibly with my toes. Or the time I was offered my own reality show. Or the one where I tackled a robber barefoot at 3AM. Or the time I was a mom to 14 bunnies at once. Or the night I pitched my startup to Marcus Lemonis from tv series The Profit.</p>

          <p>As a storyteller, an entrepreneur, and an experience designer, I leverage the stories and experiences of myself and others to tackle big problems and create meaningful solutions that aim to leave the greatest impact possible. Empathy is my superpower and I use it to understand what is and is not working for people today so that I can design for a better tomorrow.</p>

          <p>In my free time I love eating toast, carrying my bunnies around in socks, playing tennis, and discovering my problems arenâ€™t real problems while scrolling through Reddit.</p>
