        <p>This video is one that I made as an individual project for my visual storytelling class. It sums up my passion for Haven and the reason behind why I founded the company, how it has developed over the years, and what I am looking for to continue pushing it forward.</p>

        <p>I am currently working on a rebrand, so my full case study is not available yet for viewing here. However, feel free to ask me about it if you are interested and I’d be happy to share more in depth of what I’ve been working on! </p>
